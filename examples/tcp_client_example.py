Main script

Do your stuff here, this file is similar to the loop() function on Arduino

Create a Modbus TCP client (slave) which can be requested for data or set with
specific values by a host device.

The TCP port and IP address can be choosen freely. The register definitions of
the client can be defined by the user.
